  # Represents a single database record of any form type (member, project,
  # publication, …).
  #
  # Each Dataset maps to one named graph in the triple store.  The graph URI
  # follows the pattern:
  #   #{BASE_URI}<form_type>/context/<primary_id>
  #
  # Field definitions are read from the OWL ontology at runtime via SPARQL and
  # cached per (form_type, language) pair.  For each field, a pair of singleton
  # getter/setter methods is defined on the instance so that field values can be
  # accessed by the Ruby method name declared in the ontology (+local:method+).
  #
  # == Cross-reference fields
  # Fields that link to records in another form carry three extra ontology
  # properties (+local:references+, +local:references-via+,
  # +local:references-label+) which drive the typeahead widget in the GUI.
  # The stored value is whatever +references-via+ points to (e.g. an ORCiD),
  # while the typeahead searches and displays using +references-label+ (e.g. a
  # surname).

    # Server-side, AUTHORITATIVE computation of every calculated field this
    # form declares (see local:has-formulas' doc comment in the .owl file
    # for the full design rationale). Called from
    # +load_from_params_and_write+ *after* the ordinary per-field coercion
    # loop, so it always overwrites whatever a calculated field's own
    # widget happened to submit (nothing, in practice — the widget's visible
    # input carries no +name+ attribute, see app/views/_calculated.erb) with
    # a value computed fresh from this submission's other field values.
    # This is what makes the mechanism trustworthy: nothing a user could
    # type or tamper with in the browser ever reaches the database directly
    # for a calculated field — only this method's own output does.
    #
    # == Dependency CHAINS are supported (one calculated field can reference
    #    another)
    # A real example that forced this: "CBGP overheads" = 5% of "UPM
    # overheads", which is itself 25% of Total funding. Dentaku only ever
    # evaluates one flat expression at a time, so a chain like that can't be
    # solved in a single pass — CBGP overheads' formula needs UPM
    # overheads' value, which doesn't exist yet the first time we look.
    #
    # Solved with a straightforward FIXED-POINT ITERATION, not a real
    # dependency graph/topological sort: repeatedly re-attempt whatever
    # calculated fields haven't resolved yet, each pass with the
    # freshly-widened set of already-computed values folded back in as
    # available variables, until either everything resolves or a full pass
    # makes no further progress. Bounded to +formulas.size+ passes — always
    # enough for any acyclic chain (one field resolves per pass, worst
    # case) — so a genuine circular reference (A needs B, needs A) just
    # stops making progress and both stay blank, rather than looping
    # forever. No explicit cycle detection/error for that case (yet) — it
    # fails the same safe, silent way a missing base value does.
    #
    # == Building Dentaku's variable set (each pass)
    # Every OTHER *scalar* (Single-cardinality) field's current value on
    # +dataset+ becomes a Dentaku variable, keyed by its questionclass
    # fragment — exactly the "ontology term ID" an ontology editor already
    # writes formulas in terms of, so no separate ID scheme to learn. This
    # naturally includes any calculated field that resolved in an EARLIER
    # pass (it's no longer "pending", so it's no longer excluded) — that's
    # what makes the chain resolve. Two things are still always excluded:
    # * Multiple-cardinality fields — Dentaku variables must be scalar, and
    #   this codebase does not yet support aggregating an array (e.g.
    #   summing a not-yet-existing yearly-disbursement field) into one.
    # * Calculated fields that HAVEN'T resolved yet this pass — see above.
    #
    # == Error handling
    # A missing/blank dependency (Dentaku::UnboundVariableError) is treated
    # as ordinary, not an error, on any given pass — the calculated field
    # just stays pending and gets retried next pass (or, if nothing ever
    # provides that dependency, stays blank at the end — same as if it had
    # no formula at all). This is the expected, common case (e.g. an
    # overheads formula needs Total funding, but Total funding is optional
    # and was left blank). Anything else Dentaku raises (a malformed
    # formula, division by zero) genuinely means something is wrong and IS
    # surfaced as a friendly error, via the exact same {label:, message:}
    # shape the required-fields pass uses, so it renders in the same error
    # banner — and, unlike an unbound variable, is NOT retried on a later
    # pass (retrying a genuinely malformed formula can't ever succeed).
    #
    # @param dataset [CBGP::Dataset] a dataset whose non-calculated fields
    #   have already been coerced from submitted params
