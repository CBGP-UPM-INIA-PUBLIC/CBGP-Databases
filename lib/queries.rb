# Dataset persistence — SPARQL queries for reading, writing, and deleting
# records stored as named graphs.
#
# Each record lives in its own named graph whose URI follows the pattern:
#   #{BASE_URI}<form_type>/context/<primary_id>
#
# Inside the graph, fields are encoded using the SIO reified-attribute pattern:
#   <dataset_node> sio:SIO_000008 <attribute_node> .
#   <attribute_node> rdf:type cbgp:<questionclass> ;
#                    sio:SIO_000300 "<literal_value>" .
#
# Provenance triples (dcterms:created / dcterms:modified / dcterms:type) are
# written INSIDE each record's own named graph, subject = the graph's own
# URI. Every reader already knows the specific graph URI in advance (there is
# no cross-graph "find by dcterms:type" query anywhere in this codebase), so
# nothing needs them to live outside it - and putting them outside doesn't
# actually work on Virtuoso: its INSERT DATA implementation requires an
# explicit default-graph preamble for any triple not wrapped in its own
# GRAPH {} block, which SPARQL 1.1 doesn't provide a way to supply for
# INSERT DATA specifically (confirmed live, 2026-08-26, migrating personnel
# data - GraphDB tolerated the old default-graph placement, Virtuoso
# rejects it outright: "Virtuoso 37000 Error SP031: ... No plain default
# graph specified in the preamble"). delete_dataset_query no longer needs a
# separate DELETE WHERE for these triples either - DROP GRAPH now removes
# them along with everything else in the record's graph.

# Removes a named graph from the CURRENT-state repository (DATABASE), first
# snapshotting its prior state into the separate HISTORY repository
# (HISTORY_DATABASE/HISTORY_DATABASE_UPDATE) — this is the SCD Type 2
# recording mechanism. Called for both true deletes (reason: 'deleted', the
# default — single/multi-select delete, utilities/purge_dataset.rb) and, from
# write_dataset_to_db_query, edits (reason: 'superseded').
#
# Steps:
#   1. Read the live graph's own dcterms:created/dcterms:modified (inside the
#      graph itself, subject = graph URI) before touching anything.
#      dcterms:modified becomes the snapshot's prov:generatedAtTime (when
#      *this* version became current); dcterms:created is returned so the
#      caller can preserve it into the new write instead of losing it.
#   2. CONSTRUCT the old graph's triples out of DATABASE (read-only) and
#      INSERT them verbatim into a freshly-named graph in HISTORY_DATABASE,
#      then annotate that SAME snapshot graph (subject = the snapshot's own
#      URI, not a resource inside it — deliberately nanopub/PROV-style, not
#      mixed into the assertion data) with prov:generatedAtTime/
#      prov:invalidatedAtTime/local:history-reason/local:history-detail.
#      Two independent repositories are used — no SPARQL federation, no
#      INSERT-WHERE across connections.
#   3. Only then remove the live graph from DATABASE via DROP GRAPH, which
#      takes its provenance triples with it since they live inside it —
#      unchanged from the original delete logic in spirit, simpler in
#      practice (no separate cleanup step needed for triples that used to
#      live outside the graph).
