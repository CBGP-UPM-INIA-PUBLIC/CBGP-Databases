  # above) were Currency. An untyped money field silently skips locale-aware
  # parsing/validation on save, locale-aware formatting on display, and
  # canonical-form normalization on search (see spec/lib/search_accent_spec.rb
  # and lib/queries.rb's currency branch in build_search_query). Every field
  # semantically representing a monetary amount must carry class "currency" so
  # none of that happens by accident again.

  # Field list refreshed for Sara's 2026-08 project-fields restructuring
  # (personnel_project's own currency fields, since generic "project" no
  # longer exists). NOTE: while refreshing this list, national_regional_
  # research_project's year4_direct_costs field was found still mistagged
  # (local:widget-type points at "https://w3id.org/cbgp-app#currency" -
  # lowercase "cbgp-app", not "CBGP-App" - so it doesn't match "currency"
  # here) - the same class of bug this spec exists to catch, flagged to Sara
  # separately rather than silently added to this personnel_project-only list.
