# CBGP_KB drives which copy of the ontology $ontology gets loaded from. This
# project deliberately puts almost no domain knowledge in code (see
# lib/dataset_classes.rb) so that non-programmer curators can add/change
# fields by editing the ontology alone — which means the ontology changes far
# more often than this codebase does. A frozen local snapshot alone would
# silently drift out of date (a 2026-07-09 bug slipped through exactly this
# way: 4 fields had been retyped live but the committed fixture still showed
# the old type). So resolution prefers the freshest source available and
# only falls back to the committed snapshot if neither is reachable:
#   1. A sibling ../CBGP-Ontology checkout, if this machine happens to have
#      one (fast, no network) - not guaranteed, since CBGP-Databases can be
#      checked out on its own.
#   2. The live ontology at https://w3id.org/CBGP-App (same URL production
#      uses), probed with a short timeout so offline dev doesn't hang.
#   3. spec/fixtures/cbgp-application-ontology.owl, the last-resort committed
#      snapshot, used only when neither of the above is available. Refresh it
#      occasionally with:
#        cp ../CBGP-Ontology/cbgp-application-ontology.owl spec/fixtures/
